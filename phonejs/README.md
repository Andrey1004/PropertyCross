## PhoneJS

[PhoneJS](http://phonejs.devexpress.com/) is a commercial HTML5 framework for cross platform mobile application development from [DevExpress](http://www.devexpress.com/). PhoneJS is free for non-commercial use. 

PhoneJS uses the [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) MVVM framework for structuring the application, with the PhoneJS CSS providing a native-styled UI for the various phone platforms. PhoneJS applications use [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) for packaging.

DevExpress also offers a more integrated solution based on PhoneJS, called [DXTREME Mobile](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/HTML-JS/), which adds Visual Studio tooling.

## Building

The documentation for PhoneJS can be [found online](http://phonejs.devexpress.com/Documentation). PhoneJS applications can be run directly from a browser, although you have to override the browser UserAgent in order to mimic a mobile browser.
