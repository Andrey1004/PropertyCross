jQuery Mobile PropertyCross
==========================

This is an implementation of the PropertyCross application using jQuery Mobile, a free and open source framework for creating mobile UIs
that mimic the native look and feel of iOS application using HTML.

Because jQuery Mobile is a HTML UI framework this project uses a number of other frameworks:

http://knockoutjs.com/ - Knockout, a JavaScript MVVM framework.
http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/ - Cordova (previously PhoneGap), which provides a mechanism for wrapping HTML / JavaScript applications so that they can be distributed
via the Apple, Android and Windows marketplaces / app strores.
http://sgrebnov.github.com/jqmobile-metro-theme/ - an open source jQuery Mobile metro theme for Windows Phone.

Building the Application
========================

Because jQuery Mobile uses HTML / JavaScript all the various applications can be run within a desktop or mobile browser. In order
to build the application for the app store you can use the PhoneGap Build (https://build.phonegap.com/) service. Each version
of the application has a config.xml file which PhoneGap Build uses to configure the application.

Conclusions
===========

TODO: expand
 - In order to deliver WP look and feel needed to duplicate the HTML
 - No decent Android support
 - iOS UI is no real match for native
 - If the WP UI was not specialised the app would have ~100% code share
