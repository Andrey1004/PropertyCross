##Introduction

[Xenarius](https://xenarius.net/) is a commercial cross-platform IDE for mobile and web development. It allows you to create responsive application screens, work with web data services or internal storages, implement application logic using a visual algorithm builder, and deploy iOS and Android apps directly to devices or publish them to stores.

## Building

To get started, you'll need an account with Xenarius. It's free, and you can sign-up [here](https://app.xenarius.net/#createAccount).

Once logged-in, click the hamburger button and select Import Project. Browse for your property-cross.xapp file and click Open. The project will be imported into your account.

You can run Xenarius applications directly from a browser or a mobile device.

To build a hybrid or native application, click Deploy on the Xenarius toolbar. When you select Hybird/HTML5 App, you will get a PhoneGap project, which you can build locally or using the [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) service. The service is free for one project.

Selecting Native App will give you a native bundle.

You can find the official Xenarius documentation online at https://xenarius.net/docs.html.
