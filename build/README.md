[Node](http://nodejs.org) is a pre-requisite of all of these processes.

##Generate CSV line-count stats

From project root, run -
```
> node build/stats.js
```

##Produce website screenshot thumbnails

This process additionally requires [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php) on the path.

From project root, run -
```
> node build/thumbnail.js
```
