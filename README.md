Cross Platform Property Finder
==============================

Introduction
-----------


Developers are finding themselves having to author applications for a diverse range of mobile devices
(iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, ...), each of which have their own 'native' development languages,
tools and environment. Cross platform technologies allow code and skills to be shared, making this an easier
(and less costly) process.

Whilst HTML5 is the 'poster child' of cross platform mobile development, there are actually a large number of
alternative technologies out there, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some allow you to create
applications with a great user experience, but the development environment is a mess, while others provide little
scope for code re-use between devices.

To help solve this problem Cross-Platform-Property-Finder presents a non-trivial application, for searching
UK property listings, developed using a range of cross-platform technologies and frameworks. Our aim is to provide
developers with a practical insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each framework.
